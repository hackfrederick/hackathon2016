# Next steps

You can do nearly anything
with the project
you have created.

We've got some ideas
for what is possible next.

* Interested in viewing the weather data on a website of your own creation?
  [Use flask]({{ site.github.url }}/flask/).
* Make your script tell you the weather
  from anywhere
  by asking for a location.
  Check out Python's
  [`input` function](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#input)
  to help out.
* Turn off your internet connection
  and run your script again.
  What happens?
  How can you handle what you see?
* Try out some other Nexmo APIs
  to see what you can devise.
* Learn about webhooks.
  Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
  to let Nexmo call your local machine
  and report back some data.
