# Beginner track

This page shows a project
that is aimed at beginners.
It will carefully walk through the steps
required to make a functioning code project.

## Goal and overview

*Coding is the superpower of the 21st century.*

Our goal with this project is
to get you hands on experience with real code.
The project should demonstrate
how you can obtain this modern superpower
and apply it to your work, your learning, or your play.

Specifically,
we will show you how to get data sent right to your fingertips.
By the time you're done,
your code will send the weather
directly to you
via a text message.

Stop and think about that for a second.
Weather information collected from satellites
will be distilled down
into a bite size chunk of information.
That information will travel over the internet,
through datacenters,
fiber optic cables,
and wireless signals
to arrive specially packaged...
for you.
*Isn't that amazing!?*
We think so.

Let's get started, ok?

## Get ready to write code

We write code in a plain text format.
This has a very specific meaning for computers,
but suffice it to say
that to write in plain text,
we need a text editor.
If you know Windows,
Notepad is a text editor.
Microsoft Word is not a text editor;
it is a word processor,
and a powerful one to boot.

While it would be possible to use a simple program
like Notepad
to write code,
such simple tools are not well suited
for software development.

Instead,
we will use Sublime Text.
Sublime Text is a powerful text editor
meant for people who want to write code.
It includes great features
like syntax highlighting
that will make your work easier.

Download it from the
[Sublime Text website](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
and install it on your machine.

## The terminal

TODO: introduce a terminal.

## A home for your code

To get started,
let's make a place
where our code can reside.
Create a directory
with whatever name you want.
For this guide,
we'll call our project `hackathon`.

```bash
$ mkdir hackathon
$ cd hackathon
```

## Setup Python

All the code for this project
will use the Python programming language.
Python is an interpreted language.
This means that Python code
is given to an interpreter program,
and that program interprets (go figure!) the instructions
and runs them.
In contrast,
a language like C++ is considered a compiled language.
With a compiled language,
the code is given to a compiler program
which converts the code into a machine readable file
(that is, another program).
The distinction isn't very important for this project.
Practically,
it means that we don't have an extra step
of putting our code through a compiler first.
We get to run the code directly.

We're going to use Python 3.5.2.
There are a variety of ways to install Python.
If you don't already have Python installed,
grab the installer from the
[Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
and install it on your machine.
