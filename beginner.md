# Beginner track

This pages shows a project
that is aimed at beginner's.
It will carefully walk through the steps
required to make a functioning project.

## Get ready to write code

We write code in a plain text format.
This has a very specific meaning for computers.
To write in plain text,
we need a text editor.
If you known Windows,
Notepad is a text editor.
Microsoft Word is not a text editor;
it is a word processor,
and a powerful one to boot.

While it would be possible to use a simple program
like Notepad
to write code,
such simple tools are not well suited
for software development.

Instead,
we will use Sublime Text.
Sublime Text is a powerful text editor
meant for people who want to write code.
It includes great features
like syntax highlighting
that will make your work easier.

Download it from the
[Sublime Text website](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
and install it on your machine.
