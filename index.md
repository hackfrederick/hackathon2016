# Beginner track

This page shows a project
that is aimed at beginners.
It will carefully walk through the steps
required to make a functioning code project.

With this whole event,
please know that the organizers are here
to help people learn.
Learning tends to work best
when you think hard
about the problem at hand,
but if you truly get stuck,
let us know!

## Goal and overview

*Coding is the superpower of the 21st century.*

Our goal with this project is
to get you hands on experience with real code.
The project should demonstrate
how you can obtain this modern superpower
and apply it to your work, your learning, or your play.

Specifically,
we will show you how to get data sent right to your fingertips.
By the time you're done,
your code will send the weather
directly to you
via a text message.

Stop and think about that for a second.
Weather information collected from satellites
will be distilled down
into a bite size chunk of information.
That information will travel over the internet,
through datacenters,
fiber optic cables,
and wireless signals
to arrive specially packaged...
for you.
*Isn't that amazing!?*
We think so.

Let's get started, ok?

## Get ready to write code

In order to start,
you machine needs to be prepared
with certain tools
and software.

[Well, show me how]({{ site.github.url }}/prepare/).

## Writing code

You ready to write some code?
We've finally arrived.
With all of the setup complete,
we can get to the task at hand.

When working with OpenWeatherMap and Nexmo,
we will use APIs.
API is short for Application Programming Interface.
An API describes how code can interact
with external services
to collect or send data.

[Start with the weather]({{ site.github.url }}/open-weather-map/).

[Then check out Nexmo]({{ site.github.url }}/nexmo/).

[Finally, put them together]({{ site.github.url }}/connecting/).

## Next steps

If you got through everything,
it's time to kick in some creativity.
[Grab some ideas and get going]({{ site.github.url }}/next/).
